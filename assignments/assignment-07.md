# Assignment 07 - Group Presentation(s)

# Due: 2020-03-18, in-class presentation 

The purpose of this assignment is to report your status on your paper.

# For an in-class presentation

* Prepare a detailed presentation (about 20--25 minutes) about the paper your group has chosen (presenter to be chosen by the group; it should be a different person than who presented in assignment 6).  Present your status about replicating and/or reproducing the results, what tools you will use, how you will evaluate the results, etc.  

* Prepare a ".md" file, with a link to the presentation in Google Docs (other formats only by my explicit approval).  Give my account read/write access on your presentation so I can give feedback.  Provide a link to the GitHub repo where the code, data, and initial results are documented.

* Submissions will be via a pull request, with the following path ".../cs395-s20/submissions/YOURACCTNAME/assignment-07/".  Every student will do this, even when working in groups.
