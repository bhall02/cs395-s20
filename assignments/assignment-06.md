# Assignment 06 - Group Presentation(s)

# Due: 2020-03-04, in-class presentation 

The purpose of this assignment is have you pick a paper that you will replicate and/or reproduce.  

# Pick a paper

* Of the papers that have been presented in class, pick a paper that you will replicate and/or reproduce as the main deliverable for this class.  

# For an in-class presentation

* Prepare a detailed presentation (about 20--25 minutes) about the paper your group has chosen (presenter to be chosen by the group).  Present a plan about how you will replicate and/or reproduce the results, what tools you will use, how you will document the results, etc.  This is your research plan for the rest of the semester.  

* Prepare a ".md" file, with a link to the presentation in Google Docs (other formats only by my explicit approval).  Give my account read/write access on your presentation so I can give feedback.  

* Submissions will be via a pull request, with the following path ".../cs395-s20/submissions/YOURACCTNAME/assignment-06/".  Every student will do this, even when working in groups.
