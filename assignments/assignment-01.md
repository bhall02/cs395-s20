# Assignment 01 - Research Identity, VSGC

# Due: before we meet next time

The goal of this assignment is to help set up your research identity and to begin the proposal writing process.  

# Part 1 - Research Identity

There are multiple parts:

* Create a Twitter account and follow 100+ accounts.  Begin by following your class colleagues, all of the accounts that [@WebSciDL](https://twitter.com/WebSciDL) follows, and some of the account that follow it (I will share additional recommendations to the class email list).  Consider using "lists" to partition accounts thematically.  This account will be a "professional" identity, so feel free to create a new account if you want to partition your professional identity from an already existing recreational identity.

* Create an account on Google Scholar.  Follow the five @WebSciDL faculty and at least five @WebSciDL grad students or alumni (see [https://ws-dl.cs.odu.edu/Main/People](https://ws-dl.cs.odu.edu/Main/People) to get started).  

* Create an ORCID.

* Create a ResearchGate account.

* Create a SlideShare account.

* Create (if you do not already have one) a LinkedIn account.

* Create a GitHub account.  Using this GitHub account, fork my repository, create a directory named with your GitHub account name inside my "submissions" with a markdown file that lists links to all of the above accounts.  Your submission will be of the form: ".../cs395-s20/submissions/YOURACCTNAME/assignment-01/index.md" and submitted via a pull request.  

# Part 2 - \#cs395s20 \#TIL 

* Using your Twitter account, before each class retweet (RT) an interesting Data Science or Web Science tool, data set, analysis, research result, commentary, etc. that you will discuss with the class for 3-5 minutes.  When you "quote tweet", add a short, constructive commentary along with the hashtags "[\#cs395s20 \#TIL](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cs395s20%20%23TIL&src=typed_query&f=live)" 

* We will repeat the "\#cs395s20 \#TIL" excercise at the start of every class.  The purpose is to engage you with current events.

# Part 3 - Review the Virginia Space Grant Consortium Fellowship / Scholarship Programs 

* note the due date of January 31!

* If you plan to be an undergraduate in Fall 2020, use "[Undergraduate Research STEM Scholarships](http://vsgc.odu.edu/undergraduatescholarships/)".

* Otherwise use "[Graduate Research STEM Fellowships](http://vsgc.odu.edu/graduatefellowships/).

* I will share a successful previous submission via email.
