# Assignment 05 - Research Paper Summary

# Due: 2020-02-26, in-class presentation 

The goal of this assignment is to give you practice reading and presenting research papers authored by others.  

# Pick a paper

* I will share a list of acceptable papers via the class email.  I will consider suggestions of additional readings if you have a paper you'd like to present.

* Working in groups of two, you will claim a paper by emailing your claim to the class email list (first-come, first served).

# For an in-class presentation

* Prepare a detailed presentation (about 20--25 minutes) about the paper: what is the motivation, what did they do, what are the contributions, were the authors successful, how much code and data are still available, etc.  

* Prepare a ".md" file, with a link to the presentation in Google Docs (other formats only by my explicit approval).  Give my account read/write access on your presentation so I can give feedback.  

* Submissions will be via a pull request, with the following path ".../cs395-s20/submissions/YOURACCTNAME/assignment-05/".
