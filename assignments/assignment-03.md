# Assignment 03 - Virginia Space Grant Consortium Proposal

# Due: 2020-01-29, in-class presentation 

The goal of this assignment is to give you exprience writing your first proposal.  This assignment will be vague, hard, and likely to be unsuccessful.  Note that your grade does not depend on VSGC funding you!  Your grade depends on a quality submission, not the outcome of the process.  Although VSGC proposals are individual, you may collaborate with your classmates.  

If you are ineligible for consideration by VSGC, we can mututally arrive at an alternate solicitation or assignment.
